# FS-Lab-MiniProject
This FILE STRUCTURES LAB mini-project in which we have used the concept of Hashing. 
The Topic : EMPLOYEE LEAVE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
Enter the employee details and later apply for the 4 types of leaves.
The hashing function is based on the ASCII value of the employee ID given it will first take sum of 0th and 1st digit and take sum and mod it with 100. Any number mod 100 is the same number here the ASCII value is taken and the value will be saved on the particular index.
Any number of values can be added on the same index. To avoid collision we have used Dynamic Hashing here the length of bucket is not fixed it will increase with the increase in the records.
The leave which one employee can take have limit to 20 only. And it have also the basic function display, delete, search, modify, etc.
The code can run any Environment we have used C++ dev.
